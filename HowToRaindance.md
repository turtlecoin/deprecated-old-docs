A raindance can happen when the TurtleBotRain wallet has acumulated 10,000 turtles.

When TurtleBotRain posts in the raindance channel it means a Raindance is about to begin!

When you see this message the RainDance will begin soon. 
Get your TRTL wallet address ready.

**Wait** and especially **don't click on any reactions or emotes yet. This will cause a disqualification!**

Wait for the “Quick, send me your wallet” message.
