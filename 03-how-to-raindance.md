A raindance can happen when the TurtleBotRain wallet has accumulated 5,000 or more TRTL. It can also be triggered at-will by an admin.

When TurtleBotRain posts in the #raindance channel it means a Raindance is about to begin!

When you see this message the RainDance will begin soon.
Get your TRTL wallet address ready.

**Wait** and especially **don't click on any reactions or emotes yet. This will cause a disqualification!**

Wait for the “Quick, send me your wallet” message.

Click on TurtleBotRain to send your address in a private message to TurtleBotRain.

You should receive a private message back that looks like something like this:

![You get a response](images/raindance/respo1.jpg)

or

![You get a different resopnse](images/raindance/respo2.jpg)

**The emoji will be different for everyone**

Now return to the #raindance channel and react with the emoji that you received in the private message.

Only click the emoji that was listed in the private message.

If you did everything correctly you will be included in the payout! Congrats!
TurtleBotRain will reply with the amount that you'll receive.
